                            Broom Track is located in the beautiful countryside
                            of Dumfries and Galloway, just 20 minutes from the
                            Scotland/England border. We benefit from being
                            situated within the tranquil Broom Estate, providing
                            the perfect environment for horses to thrive
                            naturally.

                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Our journey began in early 2024 when our daughter's
                            horse, Pride, was diagnosed with laminitis. During
                            his recovery, we were advised to restrict his food
                            intake, soak hay nets, and keep him on box rest.
                            While he was only confined for a few weeks, it was
                            clearly challenging for him.

                        <p>
                            That summer, Pride was unable to access regular
                            grass pastures. Instead, turnout was restricted to
                            winter turnout pens for limited periods, as we were
                            on a large livery yard with limited access to
                            non-grass paddocks.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            While we were fortunate to be on a good yard, it
                            became clear this wasn't the life we wanted for
                            Pride. Many nights, he was the only horse stabled
                            within the barn. Throughout the day, he was alone
                            while other horses enjoyed turnout together.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For many horse owners, summer turnout is eagerly
                            anticipated. For us, we dreaded the days when we
                            knew Pride's barn friends would be out, leaving him
                            alone for long periods.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            We realized we needed an alternative. We needed
                            somewhere Pride could have the freedom to move,
                            access appropriate forage, and enjoy the company of
                            equine friends. This is when the concept of Broom
                            Track was born.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            We began building the track in late August 2024 with
                            the sole aim of having it ready by April 2025. Every
                            weekend, we traveled 2 hours from our home in
                            Blackpool to our new home in Dumfriesshire,
                            determined to create the perfect environment for
                            Pride.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            In late March 2025, our dream became reality when
                            Pride and his new companion, Enfys, moved onto the
                            completed trackâ€”a space designed specifically for
                            horses with special dietary needs to live a more
                            natural lifestyle.
